# Change XYZ to the UID of your Industrial Dual Analog In Bricklet

setup:
	# Get threshold callbacks with a debounce time of 10 seconds (10000ms)
	publish '{"debounce": 10000}' to tinkerforge/request/industrial-dual-analog-in_bricklet/XYZ/set_debounce_period

	# Handle incoming voltage reached callbacks
	subscribe to tinkerforge/callback/industrial_dual_analog_in_bricklet/XYZ/voltage_reached
	publish '{"register": true}' to tinkerforge/register/industrial_dual_analog_in_bricklet/XYZ/voltage_reached # Register voltage_reached callback

	# Configure threshold for voltage (channel 1) "greater than 10 V"
	publish '{"channel": 1, "option": "greater", "min": 10000, "max": 0}' to tinkerforge/request/industrial_dual_analog_in_bricklet/XYZ/set_voltage_callback_threshold
